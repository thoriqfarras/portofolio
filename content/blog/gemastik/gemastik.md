# Gemastik 2024

_Pagelaran Mahasiswa Nasional Bidang Teknologi Informasi dan Komunikasi_, colloquially known as Gemastik is a national-level competitive event in Indonesia focused on mathematics and natural sciences, showcasing participants' problem-solving skills and scientific aptitude. It serves as a platform for identifying and nurturing young talent in these fields, emphasizing critical thinking and innovation.

My two brilliant friends and I joined forces to create [Repetit]('/blog/repetit/repetit.md'), which you can see in my Works tab. And thanks to our combined effort, we managed to finish as a finalist in the Software Development Division! Which is the top 20 teams in the nation!

## My role

I came up with the idea of Repetit as I was a flashcard learner myself. So I knew firsthand the pain points that we flashcards learner commonly encounter. With the advent of generative AI in the past few years, an idea budded in my mind and out came Repetit. For more details on my role, check out my [Repetit]('/blog/repetit/repetit.md') post.
