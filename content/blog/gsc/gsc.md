# GDSC Solution Challenge 2024

Held annually by the Google Developer Student Clubs, the Solution Challenge is a global competition where students develop innovative solutions to real-world problems using Google technologies.

I teamed up with 3 of my hardworking friends to come up with [Si Rene](/content/blog/si-rene/si-rene.md). Our combined efforts managed to brought us the global top 100 teams, beating thousands of teams from around the world!
