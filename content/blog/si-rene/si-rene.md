What happens if instead of bike taxis we get ambulance, the police, and the firefighter on Grab? This is what Si Rene is: an on-demand emergency services platform packaged into one mobile app.

Si Rene aims to improve Indonesia's emergency hotline infrastructure by eliminating call centers as the middlemen, channeling emergency calls straight to the desired institution.

## Notable Features

- Call an ambulance, the police, and the firefighters with just one call.
- Precise location sharing so caller doesn't need to describe location to the institution.
- Real-time tracking of dispatched services.

## My Role

I'm more of a 'hustler' person in this project, taking care of the pitch deck, business model canvas, and demo video.
